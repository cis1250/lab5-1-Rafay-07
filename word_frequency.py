# Word Frequency Exercise (Modular Version)
# TODO: (Read detailed instructions in the Readme file)
# The program now uses functions for modularity and reusability.
# 1. Prompt the user for a sentence.
# 2. Validate that it is a real sentence.
# 3. Split it into words and count how many times each appears.
# 4. Display the results.
